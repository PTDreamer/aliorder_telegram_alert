# aliorder_telegram_alert
Python app to check you orders and send a telegram message when they are about to be closed

I was tired of forgetting about orders and then realizing that they were never delivered. Aliexpress doesn't let you open a dispute after a determined time.
This app will send a telegram message reminding you about those orders so you can open disputes in time.

Requires:
```
$ pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
```
```
pip install selenium
```
